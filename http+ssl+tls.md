## CA(Certificate authority)

> In cryptography, a certificate authority or certification authority (CA) is an entity that issues digital certificates. 
> A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate. 
> This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or on assertions made about the private key that corresponds to the certified public key. 
> A CA acts as a trusted third party—trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate. 
> The format of these certificates is specified by the X.509 standard.

CA 作为可信第三方认证中心，核心在于能够为各方所信任。
